# LeKrunk-v2
Color-based unpatchable aimbot for the game krunker.io

## Note: Change ingame saturation setting to 1 for this to work 

## WINDOWS ONLY. 

## NOTE: If it doesn't work that well, increase the "color var" setting! 

### WARNING: Your antivirus will probably flag this, this is due to packing/obfuscation. If you don't feel safe, don't run it. 

#### Why do we have to pack/obfuscate it? 

This is because there are skids who steal code and claim it as their own without giving credit. That's why we have to use a packed exe, so they can't change the author's name. Unfortunately, this also means that we cannot provide source code like my other projects. Sorry for the inconvenience. 

### Made by HackerHansen and Leplix. Enjoy :)
