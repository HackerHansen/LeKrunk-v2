# LeKrunk-v2
Color-based unpatchable aimbot for the game krunker.io

## WINDOWS ONLY. 

### WARNING: Your antivirus will probably flag this, this is due to packing/obfuscation. If you don't feel safe, don't run it. 

#### Why do we have to pack it? 

This is because there are skids who steal code and claim it as their own without giving credit. That's why we have to use a packed exe, so they can't change the author's name. Unfortunately, this also means that we cannot provide source code like my other projects. Sorry for the inconvenience. 

### Made by Leplix and HackerHansen. Enjoy :)
